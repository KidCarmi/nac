## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Control-plane API (`nacd`)** with REST endpoints for endpoints, policies,
  access evaluation, audit, and authentication.
- **Access-decision engine** (`internal/access`): pure, deterministic,
  first-match-wins with secure default-deny.
- **Authentication & authorization**: Argon2id password hashing, HMAC-SHA256
  JWT operator sessions with pinned algorithm, role-based access control
  (admin/operator/viewer), and a static service token for enforcement points.
- **PostgreSQL persistence** via `pgx` with an embedded, transactional
  migration runner and the initial schema (operators, endpoints, policies,
  audit_events).
- **Redis policy cache** with a no-op fallback that preserves correctness.
- **Observability**: structured JSON logging (slog) with secret redaction,
  Prometheus metrics, and W3C trace-context propagation.
- **Audit logging**: append-only record of security-relevant actions.
- **Operational endpoints**: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/version`.
- **Deployment**: distroless non-root Docker image, Docker Compose stack, and
  hardened Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, HPA, PDB, ConfigMap,
  Secret template).
- **CI**: lint, vet, unit tests with race detector, integration tests against
  PostgreSQL, and container build.
- **Documentation**: architecture, threat model, database design, runbooks,
  guides, ADRs, and OpenAPI 3.1 specification.
